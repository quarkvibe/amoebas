- **Multi-channel delivery** (email, SMS, voice, webhook, API, file)
- **Three first-class interfaces** (Dashboard, CLI, SMS)
- **Universal storage** (SQLite baseline, PostgreSQL production)
- **Self-modifying capabilities** (AI can add features with approval)

**Self-hosted. BYOK. Perfect architecture. $29/month.**

✅ One-click operations
✅ Guided workflows
✅ Live terminal
✅ No technical knowledge needed

Perfect for: Anyone, teams, visual learners
```

---

### 2. 💻 Powerful CLI (61 Commands)

```bash
amoeba status                    # System health
amoeba generate newsletter       # Create content
amoeba database:switch sqlite    # Configure database
amoeba env:set OPENAI_API_KEY sk-...  # Add credentials
amoeba review:approve-all        # Clear queue
amoeba deployment:analyze        # Check deployment
amoeba test                      # Run tests

# All scriptable, automatable, embeddable
```

**Perfect for: Developers, automation, CI/CD, embedding in apps**

---

### 3. 📱 SMS Commands (UNIQUE!)

```
Text your Twilio number:

"status" → "✅ All healthy. 3 jobs running."
"generate newsletter" → "🤖 Done! Q: 92/100."
"queue" → "📋 2 pending reviews"
"approve all" → "✅ Approved & delivered!"

Control from any phone. No app needed.
```

**Perfect for: On-the-go, emergencies, mobile-first**

---

## 🔑 Core Concepts

### 1. Templates (Content Blueprints)

```
Template = Instructions for AI

Example:
Name: "Daily Newsletter"
Prompt: "Summarize top tech news in 500 words"
Tools: Enabled (AI can fetch news automatically)
Deliver: Email + SMS
Schedule: Daily at 9 AM

Create once, run forever.
```

---

### 2. AI Tools (Autonomous Data Fetching)

```
User: "Fetch top HackerNews posts and summarize"

AI automatically:
1. Calls fetch_rss_feed("https://hnrss.org/newest")
2. Gets 10 posts
3. Analyzes content
4. Generates summary

No manual configuration! AI handles it.
```

**7 native tools. All free. No extra API keys.**

---

### 3. Quality Pipeline (Professional Output)

```
AI generates → Parse → Safety Check → Quality Score
           → Cleanup → Validate → Review → Deliver

Every output:
✅ Scored 0-100
✅ Checked for PII, harmful content
✅ Cleaned & formatted
✅ Optionally reviewed by human
✅ Delivered when approved

Not just raw AI output!
```

---

### 4. Multi-Channel Delivery

```
One content → Multiple channels (auto-optimized):

Email:  Full article with HTML formatting
SMS:    160-char summary with link
Voice:  TTS-optimized with pauses
Webhook: JSON payload
API:    Retrieve programmatically
File:   Save to S3/local

Same content, perfect for each channel.
```

## 🔮 The Vision

**From VISION.md:**

> Amoeba is not a tool. It's a **living system**.
>
> Like a biological amoeba:
> - **Adaptable** - Takes any form required
> - **Self-sufficient** - Runs with minimal resources
> - **Self-modifying** - Evolves based on needs
> - **Simple** - Complex from simple components
> - **Resilient** - Survives any environment

**Phase 1:** Configuration via natural language ✅ (DONE)  
**Phase 2:** Template intelligence ✅ (READY)  
**Phase 3:** Code modification ✅ (Foundation complete!)  
**Phase 4:** Self-evolution ⏳ (Future)

**The platform that improves itself. Safely. Under user control.**

## 🎯 Philosophy

**From MANIFESTO.md:**

> "Every line of code is a commitment.  
> Every feature is a promise.  
> Every release is a declaration of values."

**We believe in:**
- **Precision over bloat** (focused features)
- **Freedom over lock-in** (BYOK, self-hosted)
- **Community over corporation** (open source)
- **Craftsmanship over speed** (quality code)

**From ARCHITECTURE.md:**

> "A simple blob with a million little cilia."

**Cellular design:**
- Simple core (stable, unchanging)
- Specialized extensions (cilia - swappable)
- Each component independent
- Perfect cohesion

**This is how professional software is built.**
